# My Maya Plugin Final Tool

## Animated Object Selector

[Animated Object Selector]("./src/TDFinalTool.py")
This tool allows you to select all objects that have animation keyframes on them depending on which obejcts you want to select.

* Select All Controls with Animations Button
* Select All Meshes with Animations Button
* Select All Groups with Animations Button
* Select All objects with Animations Button

This makes it easier for when you have to adjust the timing of all the animated objects, the position of the keyframes, and keying all objects without keying controllers that you don't need keyed (like when you use 'Select All by Type -> NURBS Curves...because then you're selecting both animated and non-animated conrollers).
